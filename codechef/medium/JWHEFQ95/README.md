## Problem

### DNA Storage

For encoding an even-length binary string into a sequence of `A`, `T`, `C`, and `G`, we iterate from  **left to right**  and replace the characters as follows:

- 00 is replaced with A
- 01 is replaced with T
- 10 is replaced with C
- 11 is replaced with G

Given a binary string $S$ of length $N$ ($N$ is even), find the encoded sequence.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains two lines of input.
- First line contains a single integer $N$, the length of the sequence.
- Second line contains binary string $S$ of length $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the encoded sequence.

 **Note:**  Output is  **case-sensitive**.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^3$
- $N$ is even.
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases is at most $10^3$.
- $S$ contains only characters 0 and 1.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2
00
4
0011
6
101010
4
1001

```

```
A
AG
CCC
CT
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Based on the rules `00` is replaced with `A`.

 **Test case $2$:**  Based on the rules `00` is replaced with `A`. Similarly, `11` is replaced with `G`. Thus, the encoded sequence is `AG`.

 **Test case $3$:**  The first two characters are `10` which is encoded as `C`. Similarly, the next two characters `10` are encoded as `C` and the last two characters `10` are encoded as `C`. Thus, the encoded string is `CCC`.

 **Test case $4$:**  The first two characters are `10` which is encoded as `C`. Similarly, the next two characters `01` are encoded as `T`. Thus, the encoded string is `CT`.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n;
        cin>>n;
        string s;
        cin>>s;
        string ans;
        string ans1;
        // your code goes here
        for(int i=0;i<s.length()-1;i+=2){
            if(s[i]=='0' && s[i+1]=='0'){
            ans='A';    
            }
           else  if(s[i]=='0' && s[i+1]=='1'){
            ans='T';    
            }
           else  if(s[i]=='1' && s[i+1]=='0'){
            ans='C';    
            }
           else  if(s[i]=='1' && s[i+1]=='1'){
            ans='G';    
            }
            cout<<ans;
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }

}
