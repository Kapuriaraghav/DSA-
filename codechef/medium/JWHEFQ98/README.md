## Problem

### Different Consecutive Characters

Chef has a binary string $S$ of length $N$. Chef can perform the following operation on $S$:

- Insert any character ($0$ or $1$) at any position in $S$.

Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that no two consecutive characters are same in $S$.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ — the length of the binary string $S$.
- The second line of each test case contains a binary string $S$ of length $N$ containing $0$s and $1$s only.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that no two consecutive characters are same in $S$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \le N \le 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
2
11
4
0101
5
00100

```

```
1
0
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  We can perform the following operations: $11 \rightarrow 1\underline{0}1$.

 **Test case 2:**  We do not need to perform any operations.

 **Test case 3:**  We can perform the following operations: $00100 \rightarrow 0\underline{1}0100 \rightarrow 01010\underline{1}0$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
     int n;
     cin>>n;
     string s;
     cin>>s;
     int length;
     int count=0;
     length=s.length();
     for(int i=0;i<length;i++){
        if(s[i]==s[i+1]){
            count++;
        }
     }
     cout<<count<<endl;
     
    }
}

```
